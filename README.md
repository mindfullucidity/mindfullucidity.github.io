## Getting Started üèÅ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
*   pnpm (or npm, yarn, bun)
*   [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mindfullucidity/mindfullucidity.github.io.git
    cd mindfullucidity.github.io
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # or npm install
    # or yarn install
    # or bun install
    ```
3.  **Configure Supabase:**
    *   Ensure you have the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) installed.
    *   Link your local project to your Supabase project:
        ```bash
        supabase login # if not already logged in
        supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF # Replace YOUR_PROJECT_REF with your Supabase Project ID
        ```
    *   Apply database migrations to your local Supabase instance:
        ```bash
        supabase db push
        ```
    *   (Optional) If you're starting a new Supabase project, you might need to run `supabase init` first.
    *   Ensure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` are set as environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file for local development, or in your deployment environment). These will be automatically picked up by `nuxt.config.ts`.
    *   You may also need to configure environment variables for Patreon integration if you plan to use it (e.g., `PATREON_CLIENT_ID`, `PATREON_REDIRECT_URI`).
