1. cant search by date in journal
2. when opening the app for the first time when not logged in it is wack, the topbar and navbar are appearing (aswell as the content of home under login section)
3. index topbar has title index
4. the hero buttons on index on small screens dont have enough padding
5. when redirect to home the from login the home navbar item isn't highlighted
6. the spectrum in journal entries isn't slidable on mobile
7. on mobile the delete account section looks weird (plus pretty sure it's not implemented)
8. on mobile streak show appear before recent journal entries
9. on mobile the header and log sections are too big so the create new entry isn't fully displaying on initial load
10. The color of the top section in pwa looks off
11. when editing a exiting journal, slight spacing on top right
12. make default tab selected a bit darker
13. implmenet patreon (or maybe crowdfunding) and already subscribe enhance (also remove debug toggle and maybe make role a user_metadata)
